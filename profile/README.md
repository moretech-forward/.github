## Hi there 👋


🚀 Welcome to our Git organization!

We're an active participant throughout the Forward and ITMO University Hackathon - Hackers Journey: Create Business Templates! Our goal? Crafting multiple templates with utmost care, all aimed at shaping the collective future of the web3 industry.🌐

"But what are Business Templates?" you might ask. Think of them as the WordPress for web3 - versatile, scalable, and tailored for the decentralized web landscape. 💼

During the hackathon, we've been hard at work, and we've recently conducted a comprehensive audit of our projects using the AI auditor, SolidityScan, and the static analyzer, Slither. Our commitment to excellence knows no bounds! 🛠️💡
