## Hi there 👋

🚀 Welcome to our Git organization!

We're an active participant throughout the Forward and ITMO University Hackathon - Hackers Journey: Create Business Templates! Our goal? Crafting multiple templates with utmost care, all aimed at shaping the collective future of the web3 industry. 🌐

"But what are Business Templates?" you might ask. Think of them as the WordPress for web3 - versatile, scalable, and tailored for the decentralized web landscape. 💼

During the hackathon, we've been hard at work, and we've recently conducted a comprehensive audit of our projects using the AI auditor, SolidityScan, and the static analyzer, Slither. Our commitment to excellence knows no bounds! 🛠️💡

Here's a glimpse of our repository:

- Soulbound Token: We have created templates for both ERC721 and ERC1155 standards, enabling unique, non-transferable tokens for various applications.
- MiniDAO: A template for decentralized autonomous organizations, allowing for efficient and streamlined governance. DAO is now very easy!
- Atomic Swaps: Our template facilitates the exchange of various assets (Native, ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155) across different EVM networks, ensuring seamless interoperability.

Explore our work and join us in shaping the future of the decentralized web! 🚀
